# Changelog

## 2.1.0

This release adds major changes to how CSS resets, typography, spacing, and components work in Pine. It is inspired by the approach in our [Acorn framework](https://github.com/ThemeMountain/acorn).

### Highlights

* Smarter CSS resets => less inlined styles when your ESP does automatic inlining
* Better button visuals for Outlook: using `mso-padding-alt` to keep the looks consistent with more modern email clients
* More flexible mobile spacing utilities
    * Spacers and Dividers also allow for more control on mobile
* New breakpoint for landscape phones
* Better image resets

#### Added

* New breakpoint (`max-width: 730px`), for landscape phones. Column widths stay the same as for desktop, but container is forced to 100% width

#### Updated

* All examples and components, to use the new CSS
* Outlook VML backgrounds - not using `<v:fill>` anymore (not needed for them to work)
* Spacers now use `&zwnj;` instead of `&nbsp;`
* Spacers on mobile are reset to zero-height. Use the new mobile spacing utilities to define how high a spacer should be on mobile (up to 60px)
* Renamed `body-bkg-image.html` example to `vml-body-bkg-image.html`

#### Removed

* Double `<head>` hack for Yahoo! on mobile
