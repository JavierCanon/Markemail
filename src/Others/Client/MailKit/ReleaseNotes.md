  BODYSTRUCTURE response.

### MailKit 2.5.0 (2020-01-18)

* Ignore NIL tokens in the body-fld-lang token list.
  (issue [#953](https://github.com/jstedfast/MailKit/issues/953))

  to set the preferred SslProtocol(s).
* Fixed ImapFolder.Search(string query) to properly encode the query string when the query
  contains unicode characters.
* If an IMAP SEARCH fails due to BADCHARSET, retry the search query after flattening the
  query strings into US-ASCII. This *may* fix issues such as
  issue [#808](https://github.com/jstedfast/MailKit/issues/808).

  (issue [#881](https://github.com/jstedfast/MailKit/issues/881))
* Improved processing of pipelined SMTP commands to provide better exception messages.
  (issue [#883](https://github.com/jstedfast/MailKit/issues/883))
* Modified SmtpClient.Send*() to not call MimeMessage.Prepare() if any DKIM or ARC headers
  are present in order to avoid the potential risk of altering the message and breaking
  the signatures within those headers.

  custom commands to the SMTP server.
  (issue [#891](https://github.com/jstedfast/MailKit/issues/891))

* Added support for IMAP's ANNOTATE-EXPERIMENT-1 extension.
  (issue [#818](https://github.com/jstedfast/MailKit/issues/818))
* Always use the SMTP BDAT command instead of DATA if CHUNKING is supported.
  (issue [#896](https://github.com/jstedfast/MailKit/issues/896))
* Improved SmtpClient to include a SIZE= parameter in the MAIL FROM command if the
  SIZE extension is supported. Progress reporting will now always have the expected
  message size available as well.

  developers to specify the `RET` parameter value to the `MAIL FROM` command.
* Fixed a number of locations in the code to clear password buffers after using
  them.
* SmtpClient.Send[Async]() methods that accept a FormatOptions argument will no
  longer hide Bcc, Resent-Bcc, nor Content-Length headers when uploading the
  raw message to the SMTP server. It is now up to callers to add these values
  to their custom FormatOptions.HiddenHeaders property.
  (issue [#360](https://github.com/jstedfast/MailKit/issues/360))

### MailKit 2.1.2 (2018-12-30)

* Fixed a bug in SmtpDataFilter. (issue [#788](https://github.com/jstedfast/MailKit/issues/788))
* Fixed ImapFolder.Sort() to always return the UIDs in the correct order.
  (issue [#789](https://github.com/jstedfast/MailKit/issues/789))
* Fixed *Client.ConnectAsync() to more reliably abort when the cancellation token is cancelled.
  (issue [#798](https://github.com/jstedfast/MailKit/issues/798))

### MailKit 2.1.1 (2018-12-16)

* Fixed ImapFolder.CopyTo() and ImapFolder.MoveTo() for IMAP servers that do not support UIDPLUS.
  (issue [#787](https://github.com/jstedfast/MailKit/issues/787))
* Fixed ImapClient.Connect() to capture authenticated state *before* calling OnConnected() so that
  developers that call Authenticate() inside of the Connected event handler do not receive 2 Authenticated
  events. (issue [#784](https://github.com/jstedfast/MailKit/issues/784))

### MailKit 2.1.0 (2018-12-01)

* A number of fixes to bugs exposed in new unit tests for NTLM authentication.
* Made SmtpClient, Pop3Client, and ImapClient's Connect() methods truly cancellable as well
  as made the underlying socket.Connect() call adhere to any specified client.Timeout value.
* Added support for connecting via a SOCKS4, SOCKS4a, or SOCKS5 proxy server.
* Fixed ImapClient's OnAuthenticated() method to protect aganst throwing an ArgumentNullException
  when trying to emit the Authenticated event if the server did not supply any resp-code-text in
  the OK response to the AUTHENTICATE command. (issue [#774](https://github.com/jstedfast/MailKit/issues/774))
* Modified ImapFolder.Create() to handle [ALREADYEXISTS] resp-codes.
* Fixed ImapFolder.Create() for GMail when the isMessageFolder parameter is false (GMail doesn't handle
  it when the client attempts to create a folder ending with a directory separator).
* Optimized ImapFolder's fallback for UID COPY command when UIDPLUS is not supported.
* Reduced string allocations in the Connect(Uri) wrapper.
* Added new ConnectedEventArgs and DisconnectedEventArgs that are used with the Connected and
  Disconnected events to provide developers with even more useful information about what
  server, port and SecureSocketOptions were used when connecting the client.
* Fixed SmtpClient to immediately throw stream reading exceptions instead of ignoring them.
  (issue [#776](https://github.com/jstedfast/MailKit/issues/776))
* Fixed ImapClient.GetFoldersAsync() to call ImapFolder.StatusAsync() instead of Status()
  when StatusItems are specified.
* Changed ImapFolder.GetSubfolders() to return IList<IMailFolder> instead of IEnumerable<IMailFolder>.
* Fixed ImapClient's NAMESPACE parser - it had Shared and Other namespace ordering reversed.
* Fixed ImapFolder.Create() (for special-use) to only use unique uses if any were specified multiple times.
* Modified ImapFolder.Open() to allow devs to re-Open() a folder with the same access in case they
  need to do this to work around an IMAP server bug(?).
* Fixed adding/removing/setting of GMail labels to use UTF-8 when enabled.
* Added support for the IMAP STATUS=SIZE extension which now provides a ImapFolder.Size property
  that specifies how large a folder is (in bytes). Clients can request this information using the
  StatusItems.Size enum with either ImapFolder.GetSubfolders() or ImapFolder.Status().
* Added support for the IMAP OBJECTID extension. ImapFolder and IMessageSummary now both have
  an Id property which is a globally unique identifier. IMessageSummary also now has a ThreadId
  property which is a unique identifier for the message thread/conversation that the message
  belongs to. This information can be retrieved for ImapFolders using ImapFolder.Status() with the
  new StatusItems.MailboxId enum value. The IMessageSummary.Id and ThreadId properties have
  the corresponding MessageSummaryItems enum values of Id and ThreadId, respectively.
* Added another work-around for bad GMail IMAP BODYSTRUCTURE responses.
  (issue [#777](https://github.com/jstedfast/MailKit/issues/777))
* Fixed all integer TryParse methods to use NumberStyles.None and CultureInfo.InvariantCulture.
* Added Connect() and ConnectAsync() overloads which accept a Stream instead of a Socket.
* All ImapFolder.MessageFlagsChanged, ModSeqChanged, and LabelsChanged events will now also be
  followed by a MessageSummaryFetched event containing the combined information of those events.
* Added support for IMAP's NOTIFY extension. Many thanks to [Steffen Kieß](https://github.com/steffen-kiess)
  for getting the ball rolling on this feature by implementing the neccessary ImapEvent, ImapEventGroup,
  and ImapMailboxFilter classes as well as the initial support.

API Changes Since 2.0.x:

* Obsoleted SearchQuery.HasCustomFlags() and SearchQuery.DoesNotHaveCustomFlags(). These are
  now SearchQuery.HasKeywords() and SearchQuery.NotKeywords(), respectively.
* Obsoleted SearchQuery.DoesNotHaveFlags() in favor of SearchQuery.NotFlags().
* Obsoleted the IMessageSummary.UserFlags property in favor of IMessageSummary.Keywords.
* Obsoleted the MessageFlagsChangedEventArgs.UserFlags property in favor of
  MessageFlagsChangedEventArgs.Keywords.
* All IMailFolder.Fetch and IMailFolder.FetchAsync methods that took a HashSet<string> userFlags
  argument now take an IEnumerable<string> keywords argument. Note: this only affects you if your
  code used named method parameters (e.g. userFlags: myUserFlags).

### MailKit 2.0.7 (2018-10-28)

* Added a work-around for Exchange IMAP servers that send broken multipart BODYSTRUCTURE responses
  without a `body-fld-dsp` token.
* Added support for detecting (but not using) the UNAUTHENTICATE IMAP extension.
* Reintroduced the Pop3Client.GetMessageCount() and GetMessageCountAsync() methods to allow developers
  to poll POP3 servers for new messages. (issue [#762](https://github.com/jstedfast/MailKit/issues/762))
* Fixed SmtpClient's status code logic to handle more than the expected error codes for the
  `MAIL FROM` and `RCPT TO` commands. (issue [#764](https://github.com/jstedfast/MailKit/issues/764))
* Added a work-around for IMAP servers that quote FLAGS responses.
  (issue [#771](https://github.com/jstedfast/MailKit/issues/771))
* Optimized SmtpClient's logic for byte-stuffing the message when writing it to the socket during
  the `DATA` command.
* Added an `SslProtocols` property to IMailService (was already in MailService).
* Fixed the DIGEST-MD5 charset handling.
* Fixed a bug in the BodyPart.TryParse() method that could be used when serializing and deserializing
  FETCH'd responses from an IMAP server.
* Fixed BodyPartCollection.IndexOf(Uri).
* Fixed Envelope.ToString() and TryParse() to properly deal with the rfc822 group address syntax.
* Fixed the ImapClient logic to properly handle parsing nested group addresses (not likely that
  anyone would hit this).
* Improved ImapClient's state tracking so that it is possible to re-connect the ImapClient in the
  Disconnected event handler. (issue [#770](https://github.com/jstedfast/MailKit/issues/770))
* Fixed IMAP API's that take IList of UIDs or indexes to accept 0 UIDs/indexes.
* Fixed ImapClient's BODYSTRUCTURE parser to properly handle multiple body-extensions tokens.
* Fixed ImapClient to properly handle the `* PREAUTH` greeting when connecting to an IMAP server.

### MailKit 2.0.6 (2018-08-04)

* Fixed ImapFolder.GetSubfolders (StatusItems) to make sure that the child folders exist before
  calling STATUS on them when the server does not support the LIST-STATUS command.
* Catch ArgumentExceptions when calling Encoding.GetEncoding(string).
  (issue [#740](https://github.com/jstedfast/MailKit/issues/740))
* Fixed parsing of IMAP threads where the root of a subtree is empty.
  (issue [#739](https://github.com/jstedfast/MailKit/issues/739))
* Added AuthorizationId property for PLAIN and DIGEST-MD5 SASL mechanisms.
* Added MessageSummaryItems.Headers enum to fetch all headers.
  (issue [#738](https://github.com/jstedfast/MailKit/issues/738))

### MailKit 2.0.5 (2018-07-07)

* When throwing AuthenticationException within SmtpClient, add an SmtpCommandException as the
  InnerException property to help consumers diagnose authentication problems.
  (issue [#717](https://github.com/jstedfast/MailKit/issues/717))
* Added support for the authzid to the SASL PLAIN mechanism.
* Modified ProtocolLogger file constructor to support Shared Read and an Append/Overwrite option.
  (issue [#730](https://github.com/jstedfast/MailKit/issues/730))

### MailKit 2.0.4 (2018-05-21)

* Fixed SmtpClient to use the IPv4 literal if the socket is IPv4 address mapped to IPv6.
  (issue [#704](https://github.com/jstedfast/MailKit/issues/704))
* Updated SmtpClient and ImapFolder.Append to use FormatOptions.EnsureNewLine.
  (MimeKit issue [#251](https://github.com/jstedfast/MimeKit/issues/251))

### MailKit 2.0.3 (2018-04-15)

* Fixed IMAP IDLE support.
* Ignore unknown tokens in IMAP untagged FETCH responses such as XAOL.SPAM.REASON.

### MailKit 2.0.2 (2018-03-18)

* Added work-around for ProtonMail's IMAP server. (issue [#674](https://github.com/jstedfast/MailKit/issues/674))
* Added work-around for IMAP servers that do not include msgid in the ENVELOPE response.
  (issue [#669](https://github.com/jstedfast/MailKit/issues/669))
* Added MessageSummaryItems.PreviewText to allow fetching a small preview of the message.
  (issue [#650](https://github.com/jstedfast/MailKit/issues/650))
* Added support for batch fetching IMAP message streams.
  (issue [#650](https://github.com/jstedfast/MailKit/issues/650))

### MailKit 2.0.1 (2018-01-06)

* Obsoleted all SaslMechanism constructors that took a Uri argument and replaced them
  with variants that no longer require the Uri and instead take a NetworkCredential
  or a set of strings for the user name and password. This simplifies authenticating
  with OAuth 2.0:

```csharp
var oauth2 = new SaslMechanismOAuth2 (username, auth_token);

client.Authenticate (oauth2);
```

### MailKit 2.0.0 (2017-12-22)

* Updated MailKit to fully support async IO instead of using Task.Run() wrappers.
* Fixed a resource leak when fetching IMAP body parts gets an exception.
* Fixed each of the Client.Connect() implementtions to catch exceptions thrown by
  IProtocolLogger.LogConnect().
* Removed the ImapFolder.MessagesArrived event.
* Added new Authenticate() methods that take a SaslMechanism to avoid the need to
  manipulate Client.AuthenticationMechanisms in order to tweak which SASL mechanisms
  you'd like the client to use in Authenticate().
* Added new SslHandshakeException with a helpful error message that can be thrown by
  the Connect() methods. This replaces the obscure SocketExceptions previously thrown
  by SslStream.
* Fixed support for the IMAP UTF8=ACCEPT extension.
* Improved ImapFolder.CommitStream() API to provide section, offset and length.
* Treat the SMTP X-EXPS capability in an EHLO response the same as AUTH.
  (issue [#603](https://github.com/jstedfast/MailKit/issues/603))
* Dropped support for .NET 4.0.

Note: As of 2.0, XOAUTH2 is no longer in the list of SASL mechanisms that is tried
when using the Authenticate() methods that have existed pre-MailKit 2.0.
Instead, you must now use Authenticate(SaslMechanism, CancellationToken).

An example usage might look like this:

```csharp
// Note: The Uri isn't used except with ICredentials.GetCredential (Uri) so unless
// you implemented your own ICredentials class, the Uri is a dummy argument.
var uri = new Uri ("imap://imap.gmail.com");
var oauth2 = new SaslMechanismOAuth2 (uri, username, auth_token);

client.Authenticate (oauth2);
```

### MailKit 1.22.0 (2017-11-24)

* Enable TLSv1.1 and 1.2 for .NETStandard.
* Read any remaining literal data after parsing headers. Fixes an issue when requesting
  specific headers in an ImapFolder.Fetch() request if the server sends an extra newline.

### MailKit 1.20.0 (2017-10-28)

* Fixed UniqueIdRange.ToString() to always output a string in the form ${start}:${end} even if
  start == end. (issue [#572](https://github.com/jstedfast/MailKit/issues/572))

* Be more lenient with unquoted IMAP folder names containing ']'.
  (issue [#557](https://github.com/jstedfast/MailKit/issues/557))

### MailKit 1.18.0 (2017-08-07)

* Improved logic for cached FolderAttributes on ImapFolder objects.
* If/when the \NonExistent flag is present, reset ImapFolder state as it probably means
  another client has deleted the folder.
* Added work-around for home.pl which sends an untagged `* [COPYUID ...]` response
  without an `OK` (technically, the COPYUID resp-code should only appear in the tagged
  response, but accept it anyway).

### MailKit 1.16.2 (2017-07-01)

* Added a leaveOpen param to the ProtocolLogger .ctor.
  (issue [#506](https://github.com/jstedfast/MailKit/issues/506))
* Added a CheckCertificateRevocation property on MailService.
  (issue [#520](https://github.com/jstedfast/MailKit/issues/520))
* Fixed ImapFolder to update the Count property and emit CountChanged when the IMAP server sends
  an untagged VANISHED response. (issue [#521](https://github.com/jstedfast/MailKit/issues/521))
* Fixed ImapEngine to properly handle converting character tokens into strings.
  (issue [#522](https://github.com/jstedfast/MailKit/issues/522))
* Fixed SmtpClient to properly handle DIGEST-MD5 auth errors in order to fall back to the next
  authentication mechanism.
* Fixed Pop3Client to properly detect APOP tokens after arbitrary text.
  (issue [#529](https://github.com/jstedfast/MailKit/issues/529))
* Disabled NTLM authentication since it often doesn't work properly.
  (issue [#532](https://github.com/jstedfast/MailKit/issues/532))

### MailKit 1.16.1 (2017-05-05)

* Properly handle a NIL body-fld-params token for body-part-mpart.
  (issue [#503](https://github.com/jstedfast/MailKit/issues/503))

### MailKit 1.16.0 (2017-04-21)

* Improved IMAP ENVELOPE parser to prevent exceptions when parsing invalid mailbox addresses.
  (issue [#494](https://github.com/jstedfast/MailKit/issues/494))
* Fixed UniqueId and UniqueIdRange to prevent developers from creating invalid UIDs and ranges.
* Fixed ImapFolder.FetchStream() to properly emit MODSEQ changes if the server sends them.
* Fixed SmtpClient to call OnNoRecipientsAccepted even in the non-PIPELINE case.
  (issue [#491](https://github.com/jstedfast/MailKit/issues/491))

### MailKit 1.14.0 (2017-04-09)

  (issue [#486](https://github.com/jstedfast/MailKit/issues/486))
* Improved robustness of IMAP's BODYSTRUCTURE parser in cases where qstring tokens have unescaped
  quotes. (issue [#485](https://github.com/jstedfast/MailKit/issues/485))
* Fixed IMAP to properly handle NIL as a folder name in LIST, LSUB and STATUS responses.
  (issue [#482](https://github.com/jstedfast/MailKit/issues/482))
* Added ImapFolder.GetHeaders() to allow developers to download the entire set of message headers.
* Added SMTP support for International Domain Names in email addresses used in the MAIL FROM and
  RCPT TO commands.
* Modified SmtpClient to no longer throw a NotSupportedException when trying to send messages to
  a recipient with a unicode local-part in the email address when the SMTP server does not support
  the SMTPUTF8 extension. Instead, the local-part is passed through as UTF-8, leaving it up to the
  server to reject either the command or the message. This seems to provide the best interoperability.

### MailKit 1.12.0 (2017-03-12)

* Allow an empty string text argument for SearchQuery.ContainsHeader().
  (issue [#451](https://github.com/jstedfast/MailKit/issues/451))
* Fixed SaslMechanism.IsProhibited() logic to properly use logical ands. Thanks to
  Stefan Seering for this fix.

### MailKit 1.10.2 (2017-01-28)

  encapsulated within angle brackets. (issue [#224](https://github.com/jstedfast/MailKit/issues/224))
* Fixed IMAP to properly deal with folder names that contained unescaped square brackets.
  (issue [#222](https://github.com/jstedfast/MailKit/issues/222))

  proper overload.

### MailKit 1.2.4 (2015-06-14)

* Updated SmtpClient to use MimeMessage.Prepare() instead of implementing its own logic.
* Added a new ITransferProgress interface and updated IMAP, POP3 and SMTP methods to

  (recursive) list of folders for a particular namespace.
* Added a FolderAttributes.Inbox flag that gets set on the Inbox folder.
* Fixed the IMAP code to properly treat the INBOX folder name case-insensitively.
* Added ServiceNotConnectedException, ServiceNotAuthenticatedException, and
  FolderNotOpenException as a more specific errors than InvalidOperationException.
  (Note: they all subclass InvalidOperationException so old code continues to work).

  stream. (issue [#198](https://github.com/jstedfast/MailKit/issues/198))
* Fixed usage of Socket.Poll() to not loop 1000 times per second.
* Added more ImapFolder.GetStream() overloads.

### MailKit 1.2.0 (2015-05-24)

* Added new ImapFolder.GetStream() overloads that allow fetching only the TEXT
  stream.
* Fixed ImapFolder.Search() to always treat the search results as UIDs even
  when the server (such as AOL) does not include the required UID tag in the
  ESEARCH response. (issue [#191](https://github.com/jstedfast/MailKit/issues/191))
* Fixed ImapClient to set the engine.Uri even for Windows*81 profiles (fixes
  a NullReferenceException for the various Windows*81 profiles). (issue [#192](https://github.com/jstedfast/MailKit/issues/192))
* Work around a GMail bug where it does not quote flags containing []'s.
  (issue [#193](https://github.com/jstedfast/MailKit/issues/193))

  (issue [#187](https://github.com/jstedfast/MailKit/issues/187))

### MailKit 1.0.16 (2015-05-10)

* Modified the Pop3Client to immediately query for the message count once the
  client is authenticated. This allows the Pop3Client to now have a Count
  property that replaces the need for calling GetMessageCount(). (issue [#184](https://github.com/jstedfast/MailKit/issues/184))

### MailKit 1.0.15 (2015-05-09)

* Added SearchQuery.HeaderContains() and obsoleted SearchQuery.Header() for
  API consistency.
* Added workaround for GMail's broken FETCH command parser that does not accept

  had not been explicitly set. (issue [#170](https://github.com/jstedfast/MailKit/issues/170))
* Added logic to properly handle MODSEQ-based search responses.
  (issue [#166 and issue #173](https://github.com/jstedfast/MailKit/issues/166 and issue #173))
* When an ImapClient gets disconnected, if an ImapFolder was in an opened state,
  update its state to closed to prevent confusion once the ImapClient is
  reconnected.
* Fixed a bug in Pop3Client.Authenticate() for servers that just reply with
  "+OK\r\n" to the SASL challenge. (issue [#171](https://github.com/jstedfast/MailKit/issues/171))
* Clear the POP3 capability flags if the POP3 server responds with -ERR at
  any time. Some servers will reply with a list of capabilities until the
  client is authenticated, and then reply with -ERR meaning that the client
  should not attempt to use previously listed capabilities. (issue [#174](https://github.com/jstedfast/MailKit/issues/174))

### MailKit 1.0.13 (2015-03-29)

* Added a FileName convenience property to BodyPartBasic which works the same
  way as the MimeKit.MimePart.FileName property.
* Added a MessageSummaryFetched event to IMailFolder to better enable developers
  to both provide progress feedback to their users as well as enable them to
  better recover from exceptions (such as a dropped connection) occurring during
  the fetching of message summaries.
* Added support for the IMAP SORT=DISPLAY extension.
* Added a work-around for Cyrus IMAP 2.4.16 sending untagged SEARCH responses
  when untagged ESEARCH responses are expected.

### MailKit 1.0.12 (2015-03-21)

* Fixed ImapFolder.GetMessage(), GetBodyPart() and GetStream() to throw an
  ImapCommandException rather than returning null if the server did not
  response with the message data.
* Added new, much more usable, Connect() methods to ImapClient, Pop3Client,
  and SmtpClient that take a hostname, port, and SecureSocketOptions.
* Added a workaround for smtp.strato.de's blatant disregard for standards.
  (issue [#162](https://github.com/jstedfast/MailKit/issues/162))
* Fixed ImapFolder.Close() to require ReadWrite access if expunge is true.
* Fixed IMAP SORT queries to inject "RETURN" before the orderBy param.
  (issue [#164](https://github.com/jstedfast/MailKit/issues/164))
* Implemented support for the IMAP ACL extension.

### MailKit 1.0.11 (2015-03-14)

* Make sure that the IMAP stream supports timeouts before using them (fixes a
  regression introduced in 1.0.10).
* Added BodyParts and Attachments convenience properties to MessageSummary.
* Added TextBody and HtmlBody convenience properties to MessageSummary.
* Added ImapClient.IsAuthenticated, Pop3Client.IsAuthenticated and
  SmtpClient.IsAuthenticated properties.
* Changed the ImapClient.Inbox property to throw InvalidOperationException if
  you try to access it before authenticating instead of returning null.
* Added an ImapClient.IsIdle property to check if the ImapClient is currently
  in the IDLE state.

### MailKit 1.0.10 (2015-03-08)

* Added support for the IMAP ID extension.

### MailKit 1.0.9 (2015-03-02)

* Modified UniqueId to contain a Validity value. This allows ImapFolder.Append(),
  CopyTo(), and MoveTo() to provide the caller with a way to make sure that the
  UIDs are (still) valid in the destination folder at a future point in time.
* Modified ImapFolder.UidValidity to be a uint instead of a UniqueId which not
  only makes more sense but also simplifies comparison.
* Fixed GMail Label APIs to use the modified UTF-7 encoding logic meant for
  folder names as it appears that GMail wants label names to be encoded in this
  way. (issue [#154](https://github.com/jstedfast/MailKit/issues/154))

### MailKit 1.0.8 (2015-02-19)

* Fixed the SMTP BINARYMIME extension support to work properly. (issue [#151](https://github.com/jstedfast/MailKit/issues/151))
* Fixed ImapFolder.Open() to not set the PermanentFlags to None if another
  folder was open (preventing SetFlags/AddFlags/RemoveFlags from functioning
  properly). (issue [#153](https://github.com/jstedfast/MailKit/issues/153))

### MailKit 1.0.7 (2015-02-17)

* Marked Pop3Client methods that take UIDs as [Obsolete]. It is suggested that
  the equivalent methods that take indexes be used instead and that UID-to-index
  mapping is done by the developer. This takes the burden off of the Pop3Client
  to maintain a mapping of UIDs to indexes that it cannot easily maintain.
* Fixed SmtpCommandException to only serialize the Mailbox property when it is
  non-null. (issue [#148](https://github.com/jstedfast/MailKit/issues/148))
* Fixed IMAP support to accept a UIDVALIDITY value of 0 (even though it is
  technically illegal) to work around a bug in SmarterMail 13.0. (issue [#150](https://github.com/jstedfast/MailKit/issues/150))
* Fixed ImapFolder.GetSubfolders() to filter out non-child folders from the list
  that it returns (once again, a work-around for a SmarterMail 13.0 bug).
  (issue [#149](https://github.com/jstedfast/MailKit/issues/149))

### MailKit 1.0.6 (2015-01-18)

* Fixed some issues revealed by source analysis.
* Migrated the iOS assemblies to Xamarin.iOS Unified API for 64-bit support.

Note: If you are not yet ready to port your iOS application to the Unified API,
      you will need to stick with the 1.0.5 release. The Classic MonoTouch API
      is no longer supported.

### MailKit 1.0.5 (2015-01-08)

* Added Connect() overloads which takes a Socket argument (issue [#128](https://github.com/jstedfast/MailKit/issues/128)).
* Added support for SMTP Delivery Status Notifications (issue [#136](https://github.com/jstedfast/MailKit/issues/136)).
* Modified the ImapFolder logic such that if the IMAP server does not
  send a PERMANENTFLAGS resp-code when SELECTing the folder, then it
  will assume that all flags are permanent (issue [#140](https://github.com/jstedfast/MailKit/issues/140)).

### MailKit 1.0.4 (2014-12-13)

* Modified the IMAP BODYSTRUCTURE parser to allow NIL tokens for
  Content-Type and Content-Disposition parameter values. (issue [#124](https://github.com/jstedfast/MailKit/issues/124))
* Added ImapFolder.GetBodyPart() overrides to allow fetching body parts
  based on a part specifier string. (issue [#130](https://github.com/jstedfast/MailKit/issues/130))

### MailKit 1.0.3 (2014-12-05)

* Added a new ImapFolder.Fetch() overload that takes a HashSet<string>
  of header fields to fetch instead of a HashSet<HeaderId> for
  developers that need the ability to request custom headers not
  defined in the HeaderId enum.
* Added an SmtpClient.MessageSent event and an OnMessageSent() method
  that can be overridden.

### MailKit 1.0.2 (2014-11-23)

* Modified ProtocolLogger to flush the stream at the end of each Log().
* Fixed IMAP SEARCH queries with empty string arguments.
* Fixed the IMAP FETCH parser to accept qstrings and literals for
  header field names.
* Improved documentation.

### MailKit 1.0.1 (2014-10-27)

* Fixed Pop3Client.GetMessages (int startIndex, int count, ...) to use
  1-based sequence numbers.
* Fixed POP3 PIPELINING support to work as intended (issue [#114](https://github.com/jstedfast/MailKit/issues/114)).
* Added a work-around for Office365.com IMAP to avoid
  ImapProtocolExceptions about unexpected '[' tokens when moving or
  copying messages between folders (issue [#115](https://github.com/jstedfast/MailKit/issues/115)).
* Disabled SSLv3 for security reasons (POODLE), opting instead to use TLS.
