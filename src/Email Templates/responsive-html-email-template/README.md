Responsive HTML Email Template
========

This template is designed to work on all major email platforms. It is built with media query, making it responsive for smartphones that support media query. It serves as a foundation that has been tested and thoroughly reviewed for compatibility, making it very easy to customize and make changes.

Using MailChimp's html email template (blue-print) as the foundation, this template is an improved version with more row options, redefined structure and many fixes for Outlook, Yahoo, Hotmail, Gmail, e.t.c.
