        <h1>Re: Ugly emails</h1>
        <hr>
        <p>Dear John Doe,</p>
        <p>It's 2016 and people still send ugly and unprofessional looking emails, which often force the recipient to turn his head to read a single sentence. I've created a very simple yet sleek looking HTML template based on <a href="http://getskeleton.com/">Skeleton</a> to solve these problems. It's perfect for both personal and professional use!</p>
        <button onclick="location.href='https://github.com/Artilex/skeleton-email-template'" class="button">Check it out!</button>
        <p>I'm sure this template will improve the world. No longer will people have to turn their heads, and no longer will they have to stare at ugly emails!</p>
        <p>Yours sincerely,
            <br>&mdash; Artilex</p>
