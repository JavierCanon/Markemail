## How to use

### Inlined

You can use the inlined files found in [/templates-inlined/](templates-inlined/) straight away with your favorite email client. Each client handles the use of HTML files differently, so please refer to the documentation of your client for more details.

### Non inlined *(Recommended)*

If none of the templates suit your needs then this is the way to go for you.

1. Edit one of the files found in [/templates/](templates/) to your liking
  - Additionally you can download the [CSS file](css/skeleton.css) and alter it
2. Make sure the href in "`<link rel="stylesheet" href="PATH-TO-CSS">`" points to the CSS file
3. Inline the CSS using a style inliner like [Premailer](http://premailer.dialect.ca/)
4. Profit!
