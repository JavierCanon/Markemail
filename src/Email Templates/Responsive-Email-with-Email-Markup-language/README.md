## Responsive Email with Email Markup language üì¨

This is a series of emails I designed for the use of my company.

I used **Email Markup language** and **responsive format** for the better user experience.


    As we know, It's all in details.


In addition, I recommend MJML for those who want to create responsive emails rapidly, especially for designers.


    As the saying goes, Sharp tools make good work.

## About me üë©‚Äçüé®
Hi, I'm Venetia, a flawed product designer who devotes to building products which not only solve people's problems but make people fulfilled and be what they truly are.

Currently my goal is to be a **full-stack designer**. I've learned coding since March 2018. [Here](https://github.com/venetiachou/code-it-now-or-never) is all of my learning outcome and process.

    Live and learn.
