HTML Email Boilerplate Redux
==============================================

[![CircleCI Shield](https://circleci.com/gh/centralcollegenottingham/HTML-Email-Boilerplate-Redux.svg?style=shield&circle-token=4c887bae1ee5e6a4601c55abeb5b8fc230a524a7)](https://circleci.com/gh/centralcollegenottingham/HTML-Email-Boilerplate-Redux)

A HTML Email Boilerplate is designed to create a solid foundation for any email campaign by fixing various email client quirks from the beginning (saving headaches later!), as well as providing a good starting point for building your own email campaigns/templates.

There are various email boilerplate templates around, however [Central College Nottingham](https://www.centralnottingham.ac.uk) has adapted its own email boilerplate template based on a variety of sources as well our own additions based on our own research and development. We regularly review changes in email client behaviour and aim to keep our boilerplate constantly up to date with the latest developments and changes in the email world.

We refer to our email boilerplate as a redux of the [original HTML Email Boilerplate](https://github.com/seanpowell/Email-Boilerplate).

## Main Features

As well as creating a solid foundation for any email campaign, our boilerplate also focuses on the following areas:

* Modular and customisable email boilerplate that suits your needs with configuration options
* Full documented with a guidelines version that explains every aspect of each line of code
* Forcing the document mode for Internet Explorer based clients
* Improved Windows Phone 7/8/8.1 compatibility
* CSS3 support in the Outlook Mobile client on Windows Phone 8+ and above (POP3/IMAP)
* Scaling images correctly in Outlook 2010 and 2013 when using DPI scaling factors greater than 96 DPI (100%)
* Improved Office 365 (OWA) compatibility (Microsoft have since improved the rendering standards of OWA [in the October 2014 update](http://blogs.office.com/2014/10/14/improving-outlook-web-app-options-settings-2/))
* Android 4.4 centring fix
* More robust method of stopping iOS data links on text like phone numbers and addresses
* Apple Mail iOS 10 auto scaling fix

As well as fixing other email client quirks that have been discovered.

## Installation instructions

This project now uses `npm` and `gulp` based packages to produce a customised and production ready version of the email boilerplate. Originally the project began as static HTML files, however overtime this become a problem where dynamic elements were needed. e.g. toggling code blocks on/off, variable values etc.

1. Install `npm` <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/" target="_blank">https://nodejs.org/en/</a> (Make sure its in your `$PATH`)
2. Install gulp globally with `npm install --global gulp-cli`
3. Clone the git source of this project and run `npm i` to install the required dependencies
4. Copy `.boilerplate.defaults -> .boilerplate.custom`. There are a range of booleans, integer and string values to tweak to your requirements
5. Run `gulp` to build the email boilerplate
6. The "compiled" email boilerplate versions will be written to:

* `dist/boilerplate/email-boilerplate.html` (Production ready)
* `dist/boilerplate/email-boilerplate-guidelines.html` (Documentation purposes)

A `tmp` directory will be created when running `gulp` these are just helper files needed during the build, they can be ignored.

**Note:** Don't place any files within the `tmp` or `dist` directory, they are cleaned each time `gulp` is run.

For further information on the available configuration options available, see USAGE.md.

## Project branches

The email boilerplate itself is split into two versions, experimental and stable. Previously this was managed by creating seperate HTML documents, however since [
1bc2b35](https://github.com/centralcollegenottingham/HTML-Email-Boilerplate-Redux/commit/1bc2b35d4e4730eb4aea203f2d8fded1a93ec0d9) this is now done via branches in the Git repo.

### Develop (Experimental) [![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/centralcollegenottingham/HTML-Email-Boilerplate-Redux/tree/develop.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/centralcollegenottingham/HTML-Email-Boilerplate-Redux/tree/develop)

This is the latest/bleeding edge version of the email boilerplate, experimental code that needs testing will appear here first, it provides a branch for testers/curious users to check out the very latest developments of the email boilerplate, but be warned, email client compatibility is not guaranteed on develop because its more of a pre-release branch.

**It is strongly recommended that you NEVER use the develop version of the email boilerplate in a live email campaign. The develop version may not have been tested thoroughly and hence its cross email client compatibility is not guaranteed. Always use the master branch!**

### Master (Stable) [![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/centralcollegenottingham/HTML-Email-Boilerplate-Redux/tree/master.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/centralcollegenottingham/HTML-Email-Boilerplate-Redux/tree/master)

This is the stable version of the boilerplate which should be used in email campaigns. It is also the default branch. 

## Boilerplate versions

Two versions of the email boilerplate exist, one version is heavily documented with HTML/CSS comments that details every aspect of the code, the other is a clean version which has all of the HTML/CSS comments removed.

**Never use the "guidelines" version in a live email campaign, as HTML/CSS comments play havoc with spam filters and even cause emails to appear blank in a few clients! You will also be adding unnecessary bloat to your HTML as well!**
