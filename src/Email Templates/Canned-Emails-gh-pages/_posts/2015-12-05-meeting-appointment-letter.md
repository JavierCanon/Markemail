I would like to request for a meeting with someone from the [management/marketing department/etcâ€¦] to discuss [topic or topics].
Anytime between [date and time 1] and [date and time 2] would be great but I am more willing to adjust to another convenient date and time of your choice.

Thank you very much for your time. I look forward to hearing from you.
