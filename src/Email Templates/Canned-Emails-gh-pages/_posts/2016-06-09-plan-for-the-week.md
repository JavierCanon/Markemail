Dear [to],

After reviewing my activities here is my plan for the week in order of priority. Let me know if you think I should re-prioritize:

Planned Major Activities for the week

 1. Complete project charter for X Project
 2. Finish the financial analysis report that was started last week
 3. Kick off Project X – requires planning and prep documentation creation. Scheduled for Thursday.

Open items that I will look into, but won’t get finished this week

  1. Coordinate activities for year-end financial close
  2. Research Y product for our shared service team

Let me know if you have any comments. Thank you!

— [You]
