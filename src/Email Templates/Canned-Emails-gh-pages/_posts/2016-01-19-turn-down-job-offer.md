Thank you so much for the offer for the Marketing Manager position. I so appreciate you taking the time to consider me and for answering so many of my questions about the company and role.

While this position seems like a great opportunity, I have decided to pursue another role that will offer me more opportunities to pursue my interests in marketing and social media.

Again, thank you for your time and support, and I wish you all the best.
