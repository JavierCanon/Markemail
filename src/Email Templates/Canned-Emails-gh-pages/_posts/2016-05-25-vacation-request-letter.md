Mr. or Ms. Last Name:

I am writing to request your approval for vacation leave from [first date of leave] through [last date of leave]. I know how important it is to ensure that my work is handled during the time I am away. I will be happy to provide training assistance and support in advance of my vacation to the team members who will be helping in my absence, and will ensure that all projects are organized in a manner that will make it easy for progress to continue as needed during the time I am away.

Thank you for your consideration and support with this request. Please let me know of your decision your earliest convenience so I can make travel arrangements.

Regards,

[you]
