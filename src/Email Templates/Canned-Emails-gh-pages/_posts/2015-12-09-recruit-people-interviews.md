Hi there,

We’re developing [IDEA] in [PRODUCT], and I’ve seen that you’ve used our current [FEATURE] extensively. I’d love let you see some early concepts of what we’re working on to get your feedback and to also let you influence our design. Basically, we want to see if what we have would actually help you do your job better.

If you’re interested and have 10-15 minutes to chat (I promise to keep the time!), reply back to this email with your choice of the times below that work for you. I’ll follow up with you to figure out what method is the best way for us to connect.

[TIMESLOTS]

 1. [EXAMPLE] Thursday, March 27th at 9AM PST

 2. [EXAMPLE] Thursday, March 27th at 9:30AM PST

 3. [TIMESLOTS CONT’D]

Thanks for reading this and helping us make things that help you get stuff done.

_P.S. If none of these times work for you and you want to participate, just reply with whatever time works for you better =)._
