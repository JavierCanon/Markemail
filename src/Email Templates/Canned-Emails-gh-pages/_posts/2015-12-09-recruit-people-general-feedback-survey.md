Hi,

I saw that you were using [PRODUCT] recently and wanted to hear what you think about it.

Could I get 1 minute of your time? It would mean a lot to me if you could just fill out this really short survey so we can know what you think of [PRODUCT].

Thanks for your help.

_P.S. Feel free to email me back if you have specific feedback, too!_
